# Large Arithmetic Collider

This repository contains the skeleton code for the "Large Arithmetic Collider" project, which comprises:

- Function stubs for all of the functions that need to be implemented as part of the project. The Large Arithmetic Collider program can be run with `stack run`. In order to complete the project, only `src/Game.hs` needs to be modified.
- A test suite for the project, which can be run with `stack test`. The source code for the test suite can be found in `test/Spec.hs`.
